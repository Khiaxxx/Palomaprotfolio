<p><h3>JUNKY TRADE SHOP </h3></p>

<p><br>Junky Trade Shop is an online junk shop platform with 
three types of users: User, Employee, and Admin.</p>

<p><h2><br>1. User Role <br></h2>
Users can sell items by uploading a picture, a short 
description, the item name, and their desired price. 
To prevent scams, they are also required to upload an MP4 
video showing themselves holding or carrying the actual item.
After submitting the item details, the user can choose 
whether they want to personally deliver the product to the 
shop or have the shop pick it up, which includes an additional fee.</p>

<p><h2><br>2.Employee Role <br></h2>
Employees are responsible for verifying the user’s submission. 
They will check if the MP4 video matches the photo and description. 
Once the product arrives at the shop, the employee confirms whether 
it is the same item shown in the video.
If everything is accurate, the employee approves the item and 
lists it in the shop so that it becomes visible to buyers.</p>

<p><h2><br>3.Admin Role <br></h2>
Administrators manage employee accounts, monitor employee activity 
(such as online status), and can access user accounts for handling 
reports or appeals. Admins also have the authority to edit or remove 
products that are inappropriate or mistakenly approved during verification.</p>
