    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Hello! I’m <strong>Hezekiah Mae O. Paloma</strong>, a passionate and dedicated 
        <strong>Frontend Developer</strong> and BSIT student from 
        <strong>Cebu Technological University</strong>.  
        I’ve always been fascinated by technology, creativity, and the idea of 
        building something that people can interact with.  
        Designing interfaces, solving problems, and creating smooth user 
        experiences have become my way of expressing both logic and art.
    </p>

        I believe that learning never stops. Every project, every challenge, and 
        every mistake pushes me to grow—not just as a developer, but as a person.  
        My goal is to become a skilled professional who can contribute meaningful 
        solutions to real-world problems, especially in the digital world.
